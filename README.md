# Awesome AI Agent Skills

A hand-picked list of practical Agent Skills and skill collections for Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, OpenClaw, Hermes, and other SKILL.md-compatible AI coding agents. Compatibility varies by project.

## Selection Criteria

Projects included here should be useful, installable, maintained, and relevant to real agent workflows. Preference goes to skills that improve coding agents in practical areas like planning, implementation, verification, security, research, product management, marketing, platform grounding, and long-running task execution.

## Classification

If an official skill is primarily about using a specific platform service, cloud product, hosted product, or product workflow, list it under Official Platform Skills first. Other skills are grouped by their primary workflow or domain, such as development workflow, research, security, product management, or marketing.
